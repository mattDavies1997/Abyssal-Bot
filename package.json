  "description": "- This bot is not designed to be reconfigurable in other cases, I am specifically making it to suit our needs with the clan's discord\r - I am not an experience programmer. I have only properly started programming for about 6 months, and this is the first time I have used discord.js, so the code is certainly not efficient, or laid out well. Especially right now since I focused more on getting an initial version released rather than write the code efficiently. Now that the bot is running, I will focus more on making the bot more scalable as I add more features to it!\r - The bot is currently in \"Alpha\". It is being run on the server with the few commands it currently has and is likely to have issues. I am doing this is to make the process of finding these issues faster, and give the members the opportunity to provide feedback on current and new features.",
