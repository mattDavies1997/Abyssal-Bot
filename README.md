# Abyssal Bot

## DISCLAIMER

- This bot is not designed to be reconfigurable in other cases, I am specifically making it to suit our needs with the clan's discord
- I am not an experience programmer. I have only properly started programming for about 6 months, and this is the first time I have used discord.js, so the code is certainly not efficient, or laid out well. Especially right now since I focused more on getting an initial version released rather than write the code efficiently. Now that the bot is running, I will focus more on making the bot more scalable as I add more features to it!
- The bot is currently in "Alpha". It is being run on the server with the few commands it currently has and is likely to have issues. I am doing this is to make the process of finding these issues faster, and give the members the opportunity to provide feedback on current and new features.

## Overview

This bot is designed to make the organisitonal side of running the clan and discord server significantly easier, while alsp providing some cool features for the members to use, hopefully encourage more activity in the discord server, and attracting more members in general.

I am currently focused on the Admin side, as the organisational part of the clan has been signficantly lacking due to the manual work that was required. It has been a pressing issue to come up with a solution to this problem, and this is it! There has already been signficant improvements in certain commonly performed tasks, such as adding new members, adding to event attendance and checking activity. Ther are plans to provide more uses to members in the future.
